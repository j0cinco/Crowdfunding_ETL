# Crowdfunding_ETL
This group project is designed to make us more comfortable using python, pandas, python dictionary methods, ERD and table schema, and Postgres databases. Together we were able to clean and convert an excel document containing all kinds of data into four separate CSV files labeled: category, subcategory, campaign, and contacts. After this, we were able to use these new databases/csv files to create a quick ERD using the QuickDBD website. Following this, we used pgAdmin4 to create a crowdfunding database schema and Postgres database. 
Overall the group was able to handle the project fairly easily with different groupmembers able to take over where others had trouble. We did get help from our lead TA during the beginning steps of the Option One: creating the contacts df and csv using the dictionary list method but was able to take over from there without further problems. The ERD tables proved more challenging than the rest of the project but still was doable.
